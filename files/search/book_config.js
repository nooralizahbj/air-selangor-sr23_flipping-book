Currently, Air Selangor \u000d\u000anorth of RM300 million annually on electricity to power its \u000d\u000awater treatment facilities. With the full implementation of \u000d\u000athe Net Zero Energy Vision, these costs stand to be vastly \u000d\u000areduced, allowing savings to be redirected towards upgrading \u000d\u000aessential infrastructure like pipes and pumps, enhancing the \u000d\u000asustainability and efficiency of water services.\u000d\u000aThe transformation will also have broader implications for \u000d\u000aapproximately 9.3 million consumers in Selangor, Kuala \u000d\u000aLumpur, and Putrajaya, who will benefit from a clean water \u000d\u000asupply generated through renewable energy. This initiative \u000d\u000awill also see Air Selangor leading the industry in adopting \u000d\u000alargescale renewable solutions through a phased approach \u000d\u000athat has started with the installation of solar PV systems \u000d\u000aat several water treatment plants and culminating in a \u000d\u000acomprehensive switch to renewables by 2040.\u000d\u000aIn Selangor, the state\u2019s sustainability objectives are embedded \u000d\u000awithin the First Selangor Plan (RS-1) which I launched in August \u000d\u000a2022 geared towards not only doubling down on Selangor as \u000d\u000aMalaysia\u2019s economic powerhouse, but building a smart and \u000d\u000aliveable state. \u000d\u000aBesides committing to achieve net zero in urban areas and \u000d\u000amunicipalities by 2050, RS-1 has also made the management \u000d\u000aof water resources a key focus area. It is in both these priorities \u000d\u000athat Air Selangor, as Malaysia\u2019s largest water services provider, \u000d\u000awill be at the forefront to ensure that the state\u2019s economic and \u000d\u000asustainability goals and objectives are met.\u000d\u000aFinancial Sustainability\u000d\u000aBeyond the debate surrounding our business and ESG \u000d\u000agoals, it is vital for Air Selangor to possess the financial \u000d\u000acapacity to these plans. While the state\u2019s financial position \u000d\u000aremains strong, with three consecutive years of financial \u000d\u000asurpluses since 2021, I continue to emphasise that all stateowned enterprises must work towards being financially \u000d\u000asustainable while implementing policies outlined by the state \u000d\u000agovernment. This means, corporations like Air Selangor must \u000d\u000adiscover the financial dynamism to fund their own operations \u000d\u000awithout relying on the state\u2019s coffers.\u000d\u000aHere, it must be acknowledged that although Air Selangor \u000d\u000aobtained funding once from the state government when it \u000d\u000awas first incorporated, it has been able to stand on its own \u000d\u000aand is taking key steps towards financial independence. This \u000d\u000awas achieved through the issuance of a RM10 billion Sukuk \u000d\u000aMurabahah Programme in 2020 that garnered a strong AAA \u000d\u000arating by RAM Rating Services Berhad (RAM Ratings) \u2013 a \u000d\u000aclear reflection of the state\u2019s own financial strength. The \u000d\u000aSukuk Murabahah Programme has enabled Air Selangor to \u000d\u000aobtain funding at optimum rates to help it fund its capital \u000d\u000aexpenditure needs, as well as exhibiting its competitiveness \u000d\u000aand resilience. \u000d\u000a PENGURUSAN AIR SELANGOR SDN BHD\u000d\u000a Sustainability Report 2023\u000d\u000a 3","\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aCHAIRMAN\u2019S \u000d\u000aNOTE\u000d\u000aOvercoming Water Scarcity \u000d\u000aAs seen in the developed world, climate change can throw a \u000d\u000aspanner in the works of water security. The National Water \u000d\u000aServices Commission (SPAN) Malaysia\u2019s water industry \u000d\u000aregulator, has indicated that Malaysia needs to invest \u000d\u000aover RM30 billion over the next three years to fortify the \u000d\u000aindustry, increase its readiness and fortify resilience in \u000d\u000aaddressing climate change.

The digitalisation of services and utilities \u000d\u000ais aimed at not just improving the state\u2019s operational \u000d\u000aefficiency, but to also strengthen capabilities in managing \u000d\u000achallenges associated with achieving sustainability goals. \u000d\u000aFor Air Selangor, smart technology has already helped \u000d\u000awith water resource management in the context of \u000d\u000ademand and supply planning, water quality monitoring \u000d\u000aand water distribution management. Air Selangor will \u000d\u000acontinue to explore opportunities for the greater use \u000d\u000aof smart technology, in line with the state\u2019s stance \u000d\u000ato elevate the standard of public services and utilities \u000d\u000athrough smart and digital technology.\u000d\u000aStrengthening Water Resiliency and Water Security\u000d\u000aA key project that demonstrates how Air Selangor is \u000d\u000asupporting both the nation\u2019s and the state\u2019s efforts to \u000d\u000astrengthen water security is through the Rasau Water \u000d\u000aSupply Scheme, which is currently in its first stage of \u000d\u000adevelopment.

However, water holds a greater \u000d\u000aimportance than energy in the baseline survival of any modern \u000d\u000aeconomy, especially in today\u2019s rapidly developing methods \u000d\u000aof production in the digital world requiring high amounts of \u000d\u000awater to cool production plants.\u000d\u000aThis is where we support our regulators call for water to be \u000d\u000agiven greater importance in the ESG goals of businesses, and \u000d\u000awhere water footprinting should become a norm as a way to \u000d\u000areduce water consumption and preserve our water reserve \u000d\u000amargins.\u000d\u000aWe as consumers should also play our part in conserving water \u000d\u000aand reducing wastages in our daily lives. According to SPAN, \u000d\u000athe daily water consumption of Malaysians is 50% more higher \u000d\u000awhat is recommended by the World Health Organization \u000d\u000a(WHO). Thus, I believe that more focus needs to be placed \u000d\u000aon promoting public awareness and education initiatives to \u000d\u000afoster a greater appreciation for water conservation.\u000d\u000aThe Future of Water\u000d\u000aThe Federal Government\u2019s proactive approach to sustainable \u000d\u000awater management promises a positive future for the country\u2019s \u000d\u000awater security as outlined in the National Water Policy 2020-\u000d\u000a2030. In the recent 5th National Water Council Meeting \u000d\u000a(MAN 5), the federal government indicated that issues such \u000d\u000aas dam safety, water pollution, and effective water resource \u000d\u000amanagement need to be addressed, underscoring the need for \u000d\u000acollaboration between federal and state authorities to ensure \u000d\u000athe optimal utilisation of water resources while maintaining \u000d\u000aquality and sustainability.\u000d\u000aAir Selangor will continue to be resolute in our efforts to \u000d\u000aadvocate and educate the importance of water security. \u000d\u000aLooking ahead, Air Selangor aims to enhance its ongoing \u000d\u000aprogrammes including doubling pipe replacement efforts with \u000d\u000aa vision to achieve a further reduction in NRW rates to 27.5% \u000d\u000aby 2025 and 25% by 2030. We are confident that by working \u000d\u000atogether as a collective unit, we can overcome challenges \u000d\u000abrought forward by climate change, preparing ourselves for a \u000d\u000amore resilient future.\u000d\u000aAs we move towards achieving our goals, I would like to \u000d\u000athank each of our 9.3 million consumers in Selangor, Kuala \u000d\u000aLumpur and Putrajaya for their continuous trust, patience, \u000d\u000aand unwavering support.

Through SPI 1: Water Forever, and SPI 7: Environmental \u000d\u000aStewardship, Air Selangor has identified action plans to mitigate the impacts of climate change to our operations. Our approach to the \u000d\u000amitigation plans is holistic and covers various aspects. This includes the commissioning of the Climate Change Taskforce, controlling, \u000d\u000areducing, and monitoring our emissions, formalising water conservation plans, improving our zero waste environment initiatives, as \u000d\u000awell as striving for full compliance with the Environmental Quality Regulations.\u000d\u000aClimate Change Taskforce\u000d\u000aAir Selangor has established a Climate Change Taskforce \u000d\u000athat will address the physical impacts of flood and drought \u000d\u000aevents.

These targets are SPIs Water Forever, \u000d\u000aImproving Asset Reliability and Resilience, Improving Operational Efficiency and NRW Reduction. Through these strategic \u000d\u000atargets, the organisation will be able to meet increasing water demand, improve water quality, reduce non-revenue water, \u000d\u000aoptimise asset management and implement good business practices within the supply chain. \u000d\u000aWater Supply \u000d\u000aSelangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya are some of the most populated states in Malaysia. The population growth has been \u000d\u000aexponential in tandem with development growth. This has caused a rise in water demand among consumers and puts \u000d\u000aAir Selangor in a challenging position in managing supply while meeting demand. As the largest treated water services \u000d\u000aprovider in Malaysia, Air Selangor acknowledges the responsibility to continuously secure a sustainable water supply for our \u000d\u000acustomers through comprehensive measures under the strategies of SPI 1: Water Forever. \u000d\u000aReserve Margin \u000d\u000aThe water reserve margin is the extra amount of water available beyond what is normally needed. It acts as a buffer to ensure that \u000d\u000athere\u2019s enough water even if demand is higher than expected or if there are disruptions in the water supply. It is determined by the \u000d\u000adifference between the distributable capacity of the water treatment system and the current demand. By 2030, Air Selangor aims to \u000d\u000aachieve 17.70% of water reserve margin.\u000d\u000a2023 has seen a significant increase in reserve margin at 15.34% as compared to 12.02% in 2022. This is primarily attributed to the \u000d\u000aadditional supply of 275 MLD from the Langat 2 Western Corridor which commenced operations on 27 August 2023, as well as the \u000d\u000aincrease in distributable capacity for the Rasau WTP from 211 MLD to 250 MLD from November 2023 onwards.\u000d\u000aCurrently in development, the new Rasau Water Supply Scheme Stage 1 will add another 700 MLD in which is expected to be completed \u000d\u000ain December 2025. Additionally, Rasau Water Supply Scheme Stage 2 will add another 700 MLD and is expected to be completed in \u000d\u000a2028. It is estimated that these projects will benefit 1.4 million customer accounts in the future. \u000d\u000aWater Supply Disruption\u000d\u000aAir Selangor continues to mitigate water supply disruptions through frequent maintenance works and early detection systems. \u000d\u000aHowever, unscheduled disruptions may still occur due to pipe burst caused by ageing pipes, pump house breakdowns and reservoir \u000d\u000aissues. Disruptions may also be caused by third-party pollution which can lead to WTP shutdowns. In the event of a major disruption, \u000d\u000aEmergency Response Plan (ERP) will be activated to mitigate the impact and support customers with alternative water supply. \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a PENGURUSAN AIR SELANGOR SDN BHD\u000d\u000a Sustainability Report 2023\u000d\u000a 61","PILLAR 2\u000d\u000aREDUCING THE IMPACT\u000d\u000aOF CLIMATE CHANGE\u000d\u000aNon-Revenue Water\u000d\u000aReducing Non-Revenue Water (NRW) remains a top priority for \u000d\u000aAir Selangor.

A sterling example of this is the Enterprise \u000d\u000aData Lake, an amalgamated data repository integrating \u000d\u000avarious source systems, including internal and external source \u000d\u000asystems. \u000d\u000aThe consolidated data repository allows for the discovery \u000d\u000aand mining of raw data from one single source of truth for \u000d\u000aconsistent and accurate insights.\u000d\u000aIn addition to the above, the Business Intelligence dashboard, \u000d\u000aconsisting of the Air Selangor Strategic Plans and Initiatives \u000d\u000aRealisation (ASPIRE) and the Operations Business Intelligence \u000d\u000a(OBI) enables Air Selangor to utilise timely information to \u000d\u000agenerate insights for decision making on strategic, tactical, \u000d\u000aand operational business drivers. This facilitates data driven \u000d\u000abusiness decision making, allowing Air Selangor to achieve its \u000d\u000astrategic objectives. Similarly, the Water Intelligence for Supply \u000d\u000aand Demand Operations Management (WISDOM), allows us to \u000d\u000amake long term strategic forecast on water demand according \u000d\u000ato specific localities.\u000d\u000aThe usage of advanced statistics and mathematics models \u000d\u000ato derive sharper insights for decision making on specific \u000d\u000abusiness operations matters has been translated into \u000d\u000aAnalytics Use Cases.
